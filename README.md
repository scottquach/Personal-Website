# Personal website built on Vue.js

This is the second iteration of my personal website built on top of the Vue.js framework with minor use of the Vuetify UI library.

The site can be accessed at www.scottquach.me

### If you would like to mess around with the code and develop on top of the site, run the following code in the root folder for hot-reload.
```
npm run serve
```
