# Personal website built on Vue.js

This is the third iteration of my personal website built on top of the Vue.js framework
The site can be accessed at www.scottquach.com

### If you would like to mess around with the code and develop on top of the site, run the following code in the root folder for hot-reload.
```
npm run serve
```
